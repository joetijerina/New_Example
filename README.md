# STM32-Hotspot/Menu System Firmware Package, based on STM32CubeWL Release v1.2.0

![latest tag](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/STMicroelectronics/STM32CubeWL.svg?color=brightgreen)

## Example

This Hotspot FW package includes:
* Application example under "Projects\NUCLEO-WL55JC\Applications\SubGHz_Phy" called MenuSystem.     
   * This example introduces a Menu Interface for transmitter (and/or receiver) application between two STM32WL55xx devices (note, two NUCLEO-WL55JC1 are needed; for the Tx and Rx, respectively). The Tx device transmits a short 10 byte packet every 2s if in TX_Multiple Radio Mode, and the Rx device receives these packets and displays the payload on the OLED display. 
   * Development tools, toolchains/compilers: STM32CubeIDE v1.8.0
   * Supported Devices and hardware boards: NUCLEO-WL55JC1
   * Known limitations: None

## Hardware and Software Requirements
  * HARDWARE:
	* Two NUCLEO-WL55JC1
      * [NUCLEO-WL55JC](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-wl55jc.html)	  
	* Two Micro-USB cables
	* Two SSD1306 OLED displays
  * SOFTWARE:
	* STM32Cube IDE v1.8 and higher
	* STM32Cube_FW_WL_V1.2.0 Firmware Package

## Set Up
* Install STM32 CubeEcosystem tools (STM32Cube IDE)
* Download the Menu-System Firmware binary file from STMicroelectronics MFT
* Attach the OLED Displays on the Nucleo-STM32WL55 Boards
* Drag the .bin file onto the Nucleo-STM32WL55 board.
* Do the same for both Nucleo-STM32WL55 Boards with the Firmware
